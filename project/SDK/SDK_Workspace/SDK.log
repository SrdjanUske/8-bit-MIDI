This project was referenced by a BSP project, which will now fail to compile properly.

We recommend that you create a new BSP project pointing to a valid hardware project. Alternatively, you can fix the project references in the BSP, and update the path to the hardware specification file in 'libgen.options', and in ELF check options in dependant applications.
